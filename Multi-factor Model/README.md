# Project 4: Multi-factor Model
* Build a statistical risk model using PCA. 
* Build a portfolio along with 5 alpha factors. 
* Create these factors, then evaluate them using factor-weighted returns, quantile analysis, sharpe ratio, and turnover analysis. 
* At the end of the project, optimize the portfolio using the risk model and factors using multiple optimization formulations. 
* For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia and sector data from Sharadar.
